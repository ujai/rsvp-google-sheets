# Standards Shaper - Create Project Standards

You are helping me establish comprehensive project standards that will guide all development work. These standards will include detailed dos and don'ts, best practices, patterns, and conventions.

## Overview

This command uses all available tools and research capabilities to create detailed, well-researched standards documents organized by category (global, frontend, backend, etc.).

**Tools Used**:
- Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob for file operations
- Exa Code Context for technical research (if available)
- Ref Documentation Search for framework docs (if available)
- Execute for environment checks

**Note**: This command gracefully handles missing MCP tools - if exa or ref aren't installed, it will continue using general knowledge and existing project patterns.

## Multi-Phase Process

Follow these phases IN SEQUENCE:

### PHASE 1: Analyze Current Project

First, understand the current project structure and tech stack.

#### Step 1.1: Check for existing standards

Look for existing standards in these locations:
- `droidz/standards/` (primary location)
- `.claude/` or `.factory/` configuration
- Project root for framework indicators

```bash
# Check what exists
ls droidz/standards/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No standards directory yet"
```

#### Step 1.2: Detect tech stack

Analyze the project to determine tech stack:

**Check for indicators**:
- `package.json` → Node.js, frameworks (React, Next.js, Vue, etc.)
- `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` → Python, Django, FastAPI
- `Gemfile` → Ruby on Rails
- `go.mod` → Go
- `Cargo.toml` → Rust
- `composer.json` → PHP
- Database config files → PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.

Use Glob to find these files:
```
Glob: ["package.json", "requirements.txt", "pyproject.toml", "Gemfile", "go.mod", "Cargo.toml", "composer.json"]
```

#### Step 1.3: Check for MCP tools availability

Attempt to use research tools but don't fail if unavailable:

**Try Exa Code Context** (gracefully handle if not available):
```
Try: exa code context query about detected framework
If fails: Continue without external research
```

**Try Ref Documentation** (gracefully handle if not available):
```
Try: ref search for detected framework best practices
If fails: Continue without external docs
```

**Output to user**:
```
🔍 Project Analysis:

Tech Stack Detected:
- [List detected technologies]

Research Tools Available:
✅ Exa Code Context: [Available/Not Available]
✅ Ref Documentation: [Available/Not Available]

[If tools unavailable, add: "Continuing with general best practices and framework knowledge"]
```

### PHASE 2: Ask User for Standards Scope

Present options to user and wait for response:

```
I'll help you create comprehensive project standards. Let me know your preference:

📋 STANDARDS SCOPE OPTIONS:

1. **Full Standards Suite** (Recommended for new projects)
   - Global standards (coding principles, error handling, testing, security)
   - Frontend standards (components, styling, state management)
   - Backend standards (API design, database, authentication)
   - Infrastructure standards (deployment, monitoring, CI/CD)

2. **Minimal Standards** (Quick start)
   - Global coding principles only
   - Framework-specific basics

3. **Custom Selection**
   - Choose specific categories you want

4. **Update Existing**
   - Enhance/update your current standards with research

Which option would you like? [1-4]
```

Wait for user's choice before proceeding.

### PHASE 3: Research Best Practices

Based on detected tech stack and user's scope choice, research best practices.

#### Step 3.1: Use available research tools

**If Exa is available**, research:
```
Query 1: "[Framework] best practices patterns 2024"
Query 2: "[Framework] coding standards conventions"
Query 3: "[Framework] testing patterns examples"
Query 4: "[Framework] security best practices"
```

**If Ref is available**, search:
```
Query 1: "[Framework] official documentation coding standards"
Query 2: "[Framework] style guide best practices"
```

#### Step 3.2: Analyze existing codebase

Use Grep to find existing patterns:
```
- Component patterns: Grep "export (default )?(function|const|class)"
- Error handling: Grep "try|catch|throw|error"
- Testing patterns: Grep "describe|test|it\(|expect"
- API patterns: Grep "api|endpoint|route"
```

### PHASE 4: Generate/Update Standards Documents

Create or update comprehensive standards files based on research and project analysis.

#### Step 4.1: Check for existing standards

First, check if standards already exist:

```bash
if [ -d "droidz/standards" ]; then
  echo "✅ Found existing standards directory"
  UPDATING_STANDARDS=true
else
  echo "📝 Creating new standards directory"
  UPDATING_STANDARDS=false
fi
```

**If updating existing standards**:
- Read each existing standard file
- Keep the structure but update examples to match detected tech stack
- Add project-specific patterns found in codebase
- Preserve any user customizations (check git diff if available)

**If creating new standards**:
- Generate from templates with project-specific content

#### Step 4.2: Create/Update directory structure

```

#### Step 4.2: Standards Document Format

Each standard file should follow this format:

```markdown
# [Standard Name]

## Overview

[Brief description of what this standard covers]

## When to Apply

- [Situation 1]
- [Situation 2]
- [Situation 3]

## Core Principles

1. **[Principle Name]**

## Resources

- [Official docs]
- [Community resources]
- [Tools and linters]
```

#### Step 4.3: Generate/Update content for each standard

For each standard file:

**If updating existing standard**:
1. Read current content
2. Keep structure (headings, sections)
3. Update examples to use detected frameworks
4. Add patterns found in codebase analysis
5. Replace generic examples with project-specific ones
6. Preserve user customizations

**Example Update Process for `backend/api.md`**:
```javascript
// Detected: Express + TypeScript + PostgreSQL

// Before (generic):
```
app.get('/users/:id', async (req, res) => {
  // Generic example
})
```

// After (project-specific):
```
app.get('/api/v1/users/:id', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
    where: { id: req.params.id }
  });
  if (!user) return res.status(404).json({ error: 'User not found' });
  res.json(user);
});
```

**If creating new standard**, include:
1. **Research-backed content** (if tools available)
2. **Framework-specific patterns** (from detected tech stack)
3. **Project-specific patterns** (from codebase analysis)
4. **Concrete examples** (with actual code from the project)
5. **Clear dos and don'ts** (with project-relevant explanations)

**Critical**: Always use project's actual:
- Framework versions (React 18, Next.js 15, etc.)
- Database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- Testing framework (Jest, Vitest, Playwright, etc.)
- Styling approach (Tailwind, CSS Modules, styled-components, etc.)
- State management (Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc.)

### PHASE 5: Create README.md

Create `droidz/standards/README.md`:

```markdown

## Error Handling

### If MCP tools not available:
```
ℹ️ Note: Exa and Ref tools not available
   Using general best practices and framework knowledge
   Standards will still be comprehensive and useful
```

### If tech stack not detected:
```
⚠️ Could not auto-detect tech stack
   
Please specify:
1. Frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
2. Backend framework (Express, Django, Rails, etc.)
3. Database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
```

### If directory exists:
```
⚠️ Standards directory already exists!

Options:
1. Update existing standards (merge new research)
2. Create backup and regenerate
3. Cancel

Your choice: [1-3]
```

## Implementation Notes

**Key Points**:
- Use all available tools (Read, Write, Grep, Glob, Execute)
- Try exa and ref but continue if unavailable
- Analyze existing codebase for current patterns
- Generate concrete, actionable examples
- Include clear dos and don'ts
- Make standards searchable and referenceable
- Link to official documentation
- Keep standards maintainable (not too verbose)

**Quality Checks**:
- Each standard should have 5+ DO examples
- Each standard should have 5+ DON'T examples
- All examples should be runnable code
- Explanations should be clear and concise
- Patterns should be framework-specific when applicable
