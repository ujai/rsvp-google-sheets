description: Build beautiful, accessible UI components using shadcn/ui library with Radix UI primitives and Tailwind CSS styling that you own and can customize completely. Use when creating accessible component libraries with copy-paste components, implementing common UI patterns (Dialog, DropdownMenu, Tooltip, Popover, Sheet, Accordion), building forms with React Hook Form integration and Zod validation, creating sortable and filterable data tables with TanStack Table, implementing command palettes (Cmd+K interfaces) with cmdk, using Radix UI unstyled primitives (@radix-ui/react-*) with custom Tailwind styling, customizing component variants and themes, building design systems with full code ownership (no npm package dependencies for components), implementing accessible keyboard navigation and screen reader support, creating consistent themeable components with CSS variables, using pre-built accessible ARIA patterns, installing components with npx shadcn-ui@latest add, customizing components in components/ui directory, working with Button, Input, Label, Select, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Switch, Textarea, Card, Badge, Alert, Toast (Sonner), and other shadcn components, or building any React/Next.js UI that requires accessible, customizable components.

## When to use this skill

- Creating accessible UI component libraries with shadcn/ui's copy-paste approach
- Implementing Dialog, DropdownMenu, Tooltip, Popover, Sheet, Drawer, or Accordion components
- Building forms with React Hook Form integration and Zod schema validation
- Creating sortable, filterable, and paginated data tables using TanStack Table integration
- Implementing command palettes (Cmd+K interfaces) with cmdk library for quick actions
- Using Radix UI unstyled primitives (@radix-ui/react-dialog, @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu) with Tailwind
- Customizing shadcn components with Tailwind utility classes and component variants
- Building design systems where you fully own and can modify the component source code
- Implementing accessible keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape, Arrow keys) automatically
- Creating consistent, themeable components using CSS variables and Tailwind config
- Using pre-built accessible ARIA patterns (roles, labels, live regions) from Radix UI
- Installing components with CLI: npx shadcn-ui@latest add button dialog form
- Customizing installed components in components/ui/ directory to match your design
- Working with Form component that wraps React Hook Form with proper labels and errors
- Using Button with variants (default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link)
- Implementing Select, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Switch components with proper accessibility
- Creating Toast notifications using Sonner integration (toast.success, toast.error)
- Building Card, Badge, Alert, Separator components for layout and messaging
- Using Input, Textarea, Label components with proper form field associations
- Implementing Tabs, NavigationMenu, or Menubar for complex navigation patterns
- Building any Next.js or React application that prioritizes accessibility and customization
